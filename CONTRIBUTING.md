# Contributing to CONTRIBUTING.md

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued.

And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. 
here are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:

> - Star the project
> - Tweet about it
> - Refer this project in your project's readme
> - Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues

to request a feature or suggest a better solution or anything, you can open an **Issue** with the appropriate label.

All best to you.
